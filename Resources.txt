Onsite training, course development, and mentoring:
Contact me directly at simon@dancingcloudservices.com if you or your
organization might be interested in customized training or course
development. I work in Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Go, and
address OO design, functional design, and software architecture
topics, and am happy to deliver training either onsite or web-based,
or to build courses and training material in video or other formats.
